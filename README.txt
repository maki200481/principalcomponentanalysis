## PCA and Logistic Regression on Cancer Dataset
This project demonstrates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on the breast cancer dataset and subsequently applies Logistic Regression to classify the data based on the reduced components.

## Requirements
- Packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn

To install the required packages, run: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository or unzip the project folder.
2. Navigate to the folder and run the script


## Output
- PCA Plot: A scatter plot showing the two principal components.
- Logistic Regression Results: Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Confussion matrix Plot
